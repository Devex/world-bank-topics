# Devex Front-End hiring challenge :wave:

Welcome to our public repository.
## Get prepared :computer:
Before the pair-programming challenge, you will need to first fork this public repo.
This application has been created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can find [instructions on how to run it here below](#Getting-Started-with-Create-React-App]).
Feel free to look at the code and get familiar with it as much as you want before the challenge.
At [Devex](https://www.devex.com), we put a lot of emphasis on clean, modularized and tested code.
Once the challenge starts, we will provide you with the different steps you will need to complete, together with a Devex engineer.

## Third-party libraries that are already installed :books:

- React
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
- [Bootstrap5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)
- [react-bootstrap-typeahead](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-typeahead) for typeahead inputs
- [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for unit testing
- [@testing-library/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) for React component testing
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) for type definition

To complete the challenge, you won't need any additional NPM package.
You won't need to bundle the app into static files either, as we will only be working with your local environment.
